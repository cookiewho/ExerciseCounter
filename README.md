# ExerciseCounter
##For those that can't count :^)
I enjoy doing my physial therapy while watching videos, so this is to keep track of your repetitions and sets while your mind id somewhere else.

### Main Focus
- [x] Make a main display that lets the user input sets and reps
- [x] Have a count down button and display the current set and rep
### Extras to round it out
- [x] Add a repetition timer option
- [x] Add a cool circle visual of said timer
- [ ] Add a stopwatch like timer in the center of the cool circle visual
- [X] Change default colors
- [ ] Add automatic timers for excercises that require both hands
- [ ] Add a rest period option for in between reps/ sets
- [ ] Stopwatch  because i feel like it would feel more complete with it
- [ ] Present in a cohesive and user friendly manner
